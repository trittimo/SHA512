Description of SHA-512. The SHA-512 compression function operates on a 1024-bit message block and a 512-bit intermediate hash value. It is essentially a 512-bit block cipher algorithm which encrypts the intermediate hash value using the message block as key. Hence there are two main components to describe: (1) the SHA-512 compression function, and (2) the SHA-512 message schedule.
