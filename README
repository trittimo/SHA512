This is a java project which generates SHA512 hashes of given input files.

If you want to run the project on the input files given to us, simply run demo.bat (on
Windows). It will demonstrate that the hash values it generates are the same as the hash
values given to us. Unfortunately I could not get the linux shell script to work, but it
can still be easily run using the java -jar command. To see the plain hash output, I would
run

> java -jar SHA512.jar data/shainput.txt; java -jar SHA512.jar data/shainput2.txt; java -jar SHA512.jar data/shainput3.txt


To see what optional arguments can be provided to the jar, run the jar file without
arguments, like so

> java -jar SHA512.jar

Source code can be found in the src directory. I compiled it with eclipse, so it can be
easily imported into that if you wish. More description of the source code can be found in
comments in the source files themselves.
